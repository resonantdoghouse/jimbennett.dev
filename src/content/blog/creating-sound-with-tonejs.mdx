## Setting up Tone.js

If you are interested in making music with JavaScript there are some great libraries that can help and one of my favorites is Tone.js.

You can add Tone.js to an html file from using a CDN like jsdelivr.net

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tone@14.7.77/build/Tone.min.js"></script>
```

Or you can install with npm using whatever build-tool you prefer

```bash
npm install tone
```

Either way, now you can use Tone.js.

## Making sound with Tone.js and JavaScript.

```javascript
//create a synth and connect it to the main output (your speakers)
const synth = new Tone.Synth().toDestination();

//play a middle 'C' for the duration of an 8th note
synth.triggerAttackRelease('C4', '8n');
```

## CodePen example

So fresh and so clean, sort of. Audio generated with Tone.js and some DOM manipulation is used to animated elements.
