## React Player Piano

A player piano created with React and Tone.js. Songs are loaded from json files that were converted from midi files, oh my!
Still a work in progress although some features include a song selection and a tremelo effect, filter, toggle. You can also play the keys by touching however multitouch is not supported yet.
